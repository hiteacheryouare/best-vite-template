## In 4 Easy Steps


### Step 1: Decide what the problem is

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead to refer to our Communtiy Guidelines for contact info.

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/hiteacheryouare/best-vite-template/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/hiteacheryouare/best-vite-template/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of will generally be accepted.

Open a PR and use the same guidelines as patching a bug

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Start writing code.

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback from peers about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Don't ask
- Figure it out yourself
- We are very busy

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

- Open a PR and follow the same guidelines as stated above

### Step 2: Submit the changes

Submit your changes in the `issues` section, or submit your PR, and wait for further review. Who knows? Maybe your code will enter our project :)

### Step 3: Failure

If your code gets denied or deleted, don't fret! Read the guidelines, and try to find another issue
